## Install the Package

```
pip install inarrator

```

## Use the Package

- Gmail

1. In the Google Cloud console, enable the Gmail [API](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=gmail.googleapis.com).

2. Register your App

    - In the Google Cloud console, go to [OAuth Consent screen](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent)
    - Once on OAuth Consent Screen, select User Type External and then click create:

    - Now complete the registration of your app which is fairly simple. Just remember two things:
        - Since this is a Testing App, you will have to add some test users (ideally make it the same email through which you are registering the app)
        - Add `.../auth/gmail.readonly` scope
3. Create "gmail_credentials.json" file:
    - Go to [Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
    - Click `+ CREATE CREDENTIALS > OAuth client ID`
    - SELECT `Desktop app` as application type

    - After this a pop up will appear which will have a option to DOWNLOAD OAuth Client JSON file.
    - Save the JSON and rename it to `gmail_credentials.json`

4. Use the inarrator

    os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = ''
    model = GPTModel(model_name = 'gpt-3.5-turbo-16k')
